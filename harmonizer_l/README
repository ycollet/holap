holharm_l 0.1.0 
<c> 2008-2009 by Josep Andreu
=============================

holharm try to be a smart harmonizer LADSPA plugin using the smbPitchShifther
engine available on http://www.dspdimension.com in periods of 128 frames.

holharm use double harmonizer engine, you can define the interval for each channel.


harmonizer engine quality can be changed on the GUI by the user, unfortunatelly to
take changes effect you need restart the plugin. But ... CAREFULLY holharm
makes hard use of your CPU. My recomentation is:

p3 or similar 		 Poor
p4 or similar 		 Fine
Dual Core or similar     Good 

Off course that can be change if you have a really tuned computer, for
example I can use Fine on my p3 933.

If you change the Quality value and your CPU cant afford that, jackd will 
crash when you start holharm, please read the Known Issues section to solve
that.


MODE OPERATION
===============

holharm has two mode operation:

Mode Normal
===========

The interval is fixed by the user in the GUI and runs as a normal harmonizer, usefull to
change song key, or do some crazy things.

Mode Selected
=============

(Use ONLY if the input audio signal is a monophonic signal (single voice, single
flute ...)

In this mode holharm analyzes the input audio signal and try to recognize the musical note, 
then adjust the interval, using the Intervals, Note and Chord Type selected
by the user on the GUI.

This is usefull to harmonize small parts of a song that use the same chord.

Known Issues
============

- In Selected Mode, holharm use the schmitt algorithm to analyze
 the input audio data for recognize notes, and is not perfect, holharm 
 discards many of the algorith return values until has a reasonable result.
 That produces a delay betwen the harmonized voices and the input signal,
 that is not so bad in most cases, anyway if the input audio data is detuned,
 is really hard to recognize notes, then is really important to use a clean/tuned 
 audio input data.

- If you have selected a great Quality and your CPU is not capable to afford
  that, the jack server will be stopped each time you start holharm, to
  solve that remove the file /home/"youruser"/.holharm or edit by hand using
  the values:

  4 for Poor
  8 for Fine
  16 for Good

  That means: on the first line of the file .. put a 4 or 8 or 16 value.
  Save and restart the plugin.



That's all folks.
