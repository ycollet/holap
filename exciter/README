exciter 0.1.0 
<c> 2008-2009 by Josep Andreu
=============================

Based on the fantastic harmonic LADSPA plugin of Steve Harris, this plugin
try to be a smart exciter helped with MIDI chord info, appling this info to
the harmonic magnitudes. Off course if no MIDI info is comming you can use
it as a plain exciter.

The way of this magnitudes are changed with the MIDI chord info ... is
right now experimental ... and sure need to be revised.

Of course ... this dynamic changes can not be applied on non
harmonic/melodic sounds, instruments like drums and more specific like Hi
Hat, Ride, Crash .... because hi not dependes of the chord harmony and
you can obtain behavoir results. For this kind of sounds you need to use
this plugin like a plain exciter.
