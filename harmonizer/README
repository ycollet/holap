holharm 0.1.2 
<c> 2008-2009 by Josep Andreu
=============================

holharm try to be a smart harmonizer DSSI plugin using the smbPitchShifther
engine available on http://www.dspdimension.com in periods of 128 frames.

holharm use double harmonizer engine, you can define the interval for each channel.


DEPENDENCIES
=============
In order to compile you will need:

dssi-dev (DSSI development)
liblo0-dev (Lightweight OSC development library)
libfltk1.1-dev (FLTK Fast Ligth Toolkit development)

CAREFULLY
=========

harmonizer engine quality can be changed on the GUI by the user, unfortunatelly to
take changes effect you need restart the plugin. But ... CAREFULLY holharm
makes hard use of your CPU. My recomentation is:

p3 or similar 		 Poor
p4 or similar 		 Fine
Dual Core or similar     Good 

Off course that can be change if you have a really tuned computer, for
example I can use Fine on my p3 933.

If you change the Quality value and your CPU cant afford that, jackd will 
crash when you start holharm, please read the Known Issues section to solve
that.


MODE OPERATION
===============

holharm has three mode operation:

Mode Normal
===========

The interval is fixed by the user in the GUI and runs as a normal harmonizer, usefull to
change song key, or do some crazy things.

Mode Selected
=============

(Use ONLY if the input audio signal is a monophonic signal (single voice, single
flute ...)

In this mode holharm analyzes the input audio signal and try to recognize the musical note, 
then adjust the interval, using the Intervals, Note and Chord Type selected
by the user on the GUI.

The Rec Times parameter is the times to validate a new note recognized,
adjust to get better results.

This is usefull to harmonize small parts of a song that use the same chord.

Mode MIDI
=========

(Use ONLY if the input audio signal is a monophonic signal (single voice, single 
flute ...)

In this mode holharm recognizes input MIDI data chords, the recognized chord is
displayed on the GUI, analyzes the input audio signal and try to recognize
the musical note and then adjust the interval, using the Intervals selected
by de user on the GUI and the MIDI chord recognized.

Of course the MIDI data chords need to be synchronized with the audio, you
can play in realtime if you are a good keyboard player, or write a MIDI track
on a sequencer and synchronize with the audio, that is easy using jack transport
using rosegarden or qtractor sequencers. MIDI chord has memory, you only
need to play/write on instance of the Chord.

Unfortunatelly anyone of the linux sequencers can manage a input Audio/MIDI
DSSI plugin, almost not today, then if you want to use this mode you need
to run holharm in a separate dssi host like jack-dssi-host or ghostess, and
use qjackctl to do the connections.



Mapped MIDI Controls
====================

Volume        MIDI Control Message   7
Pan           MIDI Control Message  10
Interval L    MIDI Control Message  48
Interval R    MIDI Control Message  49



Known Issues
============

- In Mode Selected or Mode MIDI, holharm use the schmitt algorithm to analyze
 the input audio data for recognize notes, and is not perfect, holharm 
 discards many of the algorith return values until has a reasonable result.
 That produces a delay betwen the harmonized voices and the input signal,
 that is not so bad in most cases, anyway if the input audio data is detuned,
 is really hard to recognize notes, then is really important to use a clean/tuned 
 audio input data.

- If you have selected a great Quality and your CPU is not capable to afford
  that, the jack server will be stopped each time you start holharm, to
  solve that remove the file /home/"youruser"/.holharm or edit by hand using
  the values:

  4 for Poor
  8 for Fine
  16 for Good

  That means: on the first line of the file .. put a 4 or 8 or 16 value.
  Save and restart the plugin.



Best Results
============

If you want perfect results, the best way is use a wavetoMIDI program to
generate a MIDI file with the audio melody track, then edit this MIDI track 
adding MIDI Control Messages for the Intervals, and synchronize this MIDI
file with your audio data sending the Interval changes via MIDI Control
Message to holharm using the Normal mode.

And that's all folks.
